<h4><span>1. </span>Introduction</h4>

<p>This document lays out the Terms and Conditions for the purchase of tickets to the King&rsquo;s Affair 2017, taking place on the 21<sup>st</sup> June 2017.</p>
<p>This agreement is between the King&rsquo;s Affair Committee (hereafter &lsquo;The Committee&rsquo;) and the Principal Ticket Holder. Where the Principal Ticket Holder is also purchasing a guest ticket then they also submit to this agreement on behalf of their guest.</p>
<p>Failure to adhere to these terms and conditions can lead to, amongst other things, an application being refused or voided, tickets being cancelled, entry to the Event refused or the guest being ejected from the Event.</p>
<p>Please remember that the King's Affair is organised by students with degrees to work towards and social lives to enjoy. We also have a duty to ensure that our events are accessible and enjoyable for as many people as possible, whilst maintaining financial security and preventing any adverse effects for the College or University. </p>
<p>These Terms & Conditions are designed to give a basis for ensuring that everything runs smoothly, but do not replace common sense or the discretion of the Committee or College officials. We are generally sympathetic to individual circumstances and therefore encourage you to contact us as soon as is possible should any problems caused by these Terms & Conditions arise. We reserve the right to alter these Terms & Conditions, as we see fit and without notice.</p>
